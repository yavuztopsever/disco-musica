# Disco Musica

An open-source multimodal AI music generation application that leverages cutting-edge advancements in machine learning and multimodal AI.

## Overview

Disco Musica aims to revolutionize music creation by making AI-powered music generation accessible to a diverse range of users, from novice enthusiasts to seasoned professionals. The platform offers a unified user interface for both music generation (inference) and model fine-tuning (training), fostering a collaborative and innovative ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Input**: Generate music from text, audio, MIDI, images, videos, and potentially biosensors
- **Advanced Parameter Control**: Fine-grained control over musical elements, emotional expression, structure, and creativity level
- **Unified Interface**: Single interface for both inference and training workflows
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Local resources for inference, cloud resources for training
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development and improvement
