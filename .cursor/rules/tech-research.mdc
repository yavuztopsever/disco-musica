## 1. Introduction

The advent of artificial intelligence has ushered in a new era of creativity across various artistic disciplines, with music generation being a prominent area of advancement. The field has witnessed a significant shift from traditional rule-based systems rooted in music theory to sophisticated data-driven methodologies powered by machine learning algorithms.

This evolution has been largely fueled by the increasing availability of vast music datasets and the development of powerful deep learning architectures. Concurrently, there has been a growing interest in multimodal approaches to AI music generation, where the creative process is informed by a diverse range of input modalities, extending beyond mere textual descriptions to encompass audio and visual data. This paradigm aims to create richer and more contextually relevant musical outputs by leveraging the inherent relationships between different forms of information.

Within this dynamic landscape, the user has expressed a specific interest in "Disco Musica," envisioning an open-source multimodal AI application capable of generating music within the disco genre. While the provided research material does not explicitly mention an application bearing this name, this report interprets the query as a desire to explore the potential of existing open-source AI technologies and methodologies to facilitate the creation of disco music.

Disco, a genre characterized by its infectious rhythms, prominent bass lines, lush orchestrations, and often soulful vocals, presents a unique challenge and opportunity for AI music generation. This report aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the current open-source landscape in multimodal AI music generation, identifying key projects, techniques, and research directions that could be effectively leveraged to realize the vision of "Disco Musica."

By examining the capabilities of various open-source tools and models, this document seeks to lay the groundwork for future development and exploration in this exciting intersection of artificial intelligence and musical creativity.

## 2. Overview of Open-Source Multimodal AI Music Generation Projects

Multimodal AI music generation represents a significant step beyond traditional single-input methods, striving to create music that is more deeply informed and creatively inspired by integrating diverse data sources. This approach seeks to overcome limitations inherent in relying solely on text or audio, aiming for a more holistic and nuanced understanding of musical context. However, existing techniques in this nascent field often grapple with challenges such as the scarcity of high-quality, aligned multimodal datasets and the difficulty in achieving robust cross-modal understanding.

### YuE (乐) - Foundation Models for Music Generation

One of the most notable open-source initiatives in this domain is YuE (乐), a series of foundation models specifically designed for music generation. These models excel at transforming lyrics into complete songs, producing both catchy vocal tracks and complementary accompaniment that can span several minutes. The capability to generate full songs with vocals is particularly relevant to disco music, a genre frequently defined by its lyrical content and vocal performances.

Furthermore, YuE demonstrates the ability to model a wide array of musical genres, languages (including English, Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, Japanese, and Korean), and diverse vocal techniques, suggesting a flexibility that could be harnessed to capture the specific stylistic nuances of disco.

A particularly promising feature of YuE is its in-context learning (ICL) ability, which allows it to generate new songs in a style similar to that of a provided reference track. This includes the capability for dual-track ICL, which leverages both vocal and instrumental reference tracks for potentially better results. The implication here is that YuE could learn the characteristic elements of disco music, such as its rhythmic patterns, harmonic progressions, and instrumentation, by being provided with examples of existing disco songs. This learning could then be applied to generate entirely new disco compositions, potentially even in the style of specific artists or eras within the genre.

However, utilizing YuE requires a certain level of technical expertise, as it involves installing specific environments and dependencies, with a recommendation to use Flash Attention 2 to mitigate the high VRAM usage often associated with long audio generation. This computational demand highlights the complexity inherent in advanced AI music generation.

### Visuals Music Bridge (VMB)

Another significant open-source project exploring multimodal music generation is the Visuals Music Bridge (VMB). This framework proposes a novel approach by employing explicit text and music bridges to enhance the alignment between different input modalities, particularly visual inputs like videos and images, and the generated music.

The core idea behind VMB is to address the challenges of data scarcity, weak cross-modal alignment, and limited controllability that often plague multimodal music generation. VMB achieves this through several key components:

1.  The **Multimodal Music Description Model (MMDM)** is responsible for converting visual inputs into detailed textual descriptions, acting as the "text bridge"
2.  The **Dual-track Music Retrieval module** serves as the "music bridge" by combining broad and targeted music retrieval strategies, also allowing for user control over the generation process
3.  The **Explicitly Conditioned Music Generation framework** generates the music itself based on the information provided by these two bridges

The potential of VMB lies in its ability to connect the visual aspects often associated with disco culture – such as the fashion, the dance floors, and the overall aesthetic – with the creation of disco music. If the MMDM can effectively capture the essence of these visuals and translate them into musical requirements, VMB could offer a unique pathway for generating disco music inspired by visual prompts.

The project's authors have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, including video-to-music, image-to-music, text-to-music, and controllable music generation. However, it is important to note that while the research paper detailing VMB is available on arXiv, the actual code, usage instructions, and dataset details were still marked as "TODO" at the time of the provided information. This indicates that while the conceptual framework is well-established, the practical implementation for widespread use might still be in progress.

### LLM-Based Multimodal Generation

Providing a broader context for the research landscape is the Awesome-LLMs-meet-Multimodal-Generation repository. This curated list of research papers focuses on the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal generation, encompassing various modalities such as image, video, 3D, and audio. The repository includes specific sections dedicated to:

-   Audio generation (covering both LLM-based and non-LLM-based methods)
-   Generation involving multiple modalities
-   Various techniques for cross-modal integration

The existence of this resource underscores a significant trend in the AI research community towards leveraging the powerful capabilities of LLMs for creating and manipulating diverse forms of media, including music. This suggests that future advancements in open-source multimodal music generation, potentially including specialized applications for genres like disco, might be closely intertwined with the ongoing progress in the field of large language models.

The ability of LLMs to understand complex relationships and generate coherent sequences makes them promising candidates for tackling the intricate structure and stylistic nuances of music.

## 3. Text-to-Music Generation

Text-to-music generation, the process of creating musical pieces from textual descriptions, holds significant promise for an application like "Disco Musica." Users could potentially describe the desired characteristics of a disco track – its tempo, instrumentation, mood, or even lyrical themes – and an AI model could generate corresponding music. The open-source community has seen notable developments in this area.

### MusicGen by Meta AI

One of the most prominent open-source text-to-music models is MusicGen, developed by Meta AI. This model represents a significant leap forward due to its use of a single-stage auto-regressive Transformer architecture trained on an extensive dataset of music paired with textual descriptions. This streamlined approach, where a single model handles the entire generation process, contrasts with older methods that might have required multiple models working in sequence.

MusicGen excels at producing high-quality music samples based on user-provided text prompts, and it also supports conditioning on melodic inputs, offering an additional layer of control over the generated output. For instance, a user could input a description like "upbeat disco track with a funky bassline and shimmering synthesizers," and MusicGen would attempt to create a musical piece matching these characteristics.

The ability to also guide the generation with a melody could be particularly useful for disco, where memorable melodic hooks are common. However, it's important to note that the version of MusicGen discussed in some sources has limitations, such as generating only relatively short 30-second snippets. Additionally, the quality of vocals generated by MusicGen has been noted as potentially lacking, which could be a concern for disco music that often features strong vocal performances.

#### Audiocraft Library

MusicGen is part of Meta's Audiocraft library, an open-source codebase dedicated to generative audio. The open nature of this library is a significant advantage, as it allows researchers and developers to not only utilize the pre-trained MusicGen models but also to:

-   Delve into the underlying code
-   Fine-tune the models on genre-specific datasets (like a collection of disco tracks)
-   Explore modifications to the model's architecture for specific requirements
-   Create custom generation pipelines

Audiocraft provides installation instructions and even hosts demos, making it relatively accessible for those interested in experimenting with text-to-music generation.

### Muse Coco by Microsoft

Another interesting open-source project in this space is Muse Coco, developed by Microsoft. This model adopts a two-step approach to text-to-music generation:

1.  First, a natural language processing model analyzes the input text and converts it into a structured set of musical attributes, such as the desired instruments, tempo, time signature, and genre. For example, a description of a disco song might be translated into attributes like "drums, bass guitar, synthesizers, 120 BPM, 4/4 time signature, disco genre."

2.  Second
continue
Markdown
. a separate model takes these musical attributes and generates a multi-track symbolic score, typically in MIDI format.

This approach offers a more explicit way to control the characteristics of the generated music by first defining the key musical parameters. This could be particularly beneficial for disco music, which often adheres to certain structural and instrumental conventions.

However, unlike MusicGen which directly outputs audio, Muse Coco generates symbolic music. This means that an additional step is required to convert the MIDI score into actual audio using software synthesizers or sound libraries that can emulate the sounds of disco-era instruments.

### Mubert API

Mubert presents a different paradigm for text-to-music generation. Instead of directly synthesizing audio from scratch, Mubert operates as an API that utilizes encoded text prompts and a system of tags to select and arrange pre-recorded musical loops and samples created by human musicians.

When a user provides a text prompt describing the desired music, Mubert's AI analyzes this prompt and selects the most relevant tags. These tags are then used to retrieve corresponding sound loops (for bass, leads, drums, etc.) from Mubert's vast library, and the AI arranges these loops into a unique musical composition.

This "from creators to creators" approach emphasizes the use of human-created sounds as the building blocks for AI-generated music. While this might lead to more musically coherent results as the individual sonic elements are professionally produced, it could also potentially limit the generation of truly novel sounds or styles that are not already present in Mubert's library.

Mubert offers a simple notebook demonstrating its prompt-based music generation capabilities. It's important to note that while Mubert can be used for free with attribution for non-commercial purposes, a commercial license is required for using the generated music in commercially distributed works. This is a key consideration for anyone looking to develop a commercial "Disco Musica" application using Mubert.

### Amphion Toolkit

Amphion is presented as a comprehensive toolkit for audio, music, and speech generation. Developed by Open MMLab, Amphion aims to support reproducible research and assist newcomers in the field. 

While Amphion boasts state-of-the-art performance in Text to Speech (TTS) systems and supports various TTS architectures and voice conversion models, its Text to Music (TTM) capability is noted as being under development. However, Amphion does support Text to Audio (TTA) using latent diffusion models, a technique that could potentially be adapted for generating disco music or soundscapes.

The toolkit provides detailed setup instructions using both Conda and Docker, making it accessible for researchers and developers to explore its various audio generation capabilities. The modular nature of Amphion might allow for the integration of specific components or models tailored for the characteristics of disco music as the TTM functionality matures.

## 4. Control over Musical Elements

Generating music within a specific genre like disco necessitates a high degree of control over various musical elements, including rhythm, harmony, tempo, and instrumentation. Textual descriptions alone often lack the precision required to manipulate these time-varying attributes effectively. Fortunately, several open-source projects are addressing this need for finer control.

### Music ControlNet

Music ControlNet offers a promising approach by providing a diffusion-based music generation model that allows for multiple precise, time-varying controls over the generated audio. These controls include:

-   Melody (note sequence)
-   Dynamics (volume changes over time)
-   Rhythm (timing and pattern of notes)

The underlying principle is analogous to the pixel-wise control offered by ControlNet in the image generation domain, suggesting a similar level of granularity in manipulating the audio spectrogram. 

Notably, Music ControlNet has demonstrated the ability to generate music that adheres more faithfully to input melodies compared to MusicGen, even with significantly fewer parameters and less training data. This efficiency, coupled with the precise control over fundamental musical elements like rhythm, which is central to disco, makes Music ControlNet a highly relevant technology for a "Disco Musica" application.

Furthermore, the model supports partially specified controls, allowing users to guide the generation for certain segments of time while leaving room for the AI to improvise within the given constraints. Implementation details and the research paper describing Music ControlNet are available on GitHub, providing the necessary resources for further exploration and potential integration.

### MusiConGen

Building upon the foundation of MusicGen, MusiConGen introduces temporal conditioning to enhance control over rhythm and chords in text-to-music generation. As rhythm and chord progressions are defining characteristics of disco music, MusiConGen's focus is particularly pertinent.

The model boasts an efficient fine-tuning mechanism that is suitable for consumer-grade GPUs, making it accessible for a wider range of users. During the music generation process (inference), MusiConGen can be conditioned on:

1.  Musical features extracted from a reference audio track
2.  User-defined symbolic chord sequences
3.  Specific beats per minute (BPM)

This flexibility allows for generating disco music that either aligns with the rhythmic and harmonic structure of an existing song or follows specific musical instructions provided by the user, such as a particular chord progression or a target tempo.

The official implementation of MusiConGen, including training and inference code, is available on GitHub, along with a Cog implementation that facilitates easier deployment. A demonstration page further showcases the model's capabilities in generating music based on chord, BPM, and textual conditions.

### Mustango

Taking a music-domain-knowledge-inspired approach is Mustango, a text-to-music system based on diffusion that aims to control not only general musical attributes but also specific instructions related to chords, beats, tempo, and key.

At the core of Mustango is MuNet, a Music-Domain-Knowledge-Informed UNet guidance module that helps steer the music generation process by incorporating these music-specific conditions along with the general text embedding. This architecture enables fine-grained control over musical parameters that are essential for disco music, such as:

-   Precise tempo control
-   Specific chord progressions
-   Beat patterns and groove
-   Key and scale selection

To address the scarcity of open datasets with rich musical annotations, Mustango employs a novel data augmentation method that involves altering the harmonic, rhythmic, and dynamic aspects of existing music audio. This process led to the creation of the MusicBench dataset, which contains over 52,000 music fragments with detailed music-specific text captions.

Mustango has demonstrated state-of-the-art quality and controllability, outperforming other models like MusicGen and AudioLDM2 in generating music that adheres to specific musical instructions. The project's GitHub repository provides access to the code, and live demos are available on platforms like Hugging Face and Replicate, allowing users to experience its capabilities firsthand.

## 5. Audio-to-Music and Style Transfer

Generating disco music can also be approached by leveraging existing audio examples, either by generating music that continues or is inspired by a given audio input, or by transferring the stylistic characteristics of one piece of music to another. Several open-source tools offer capabilities in this area.

### YuE Style Transfer Capabilities

As mentioned earlier, YuE possesses strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities that extend to music style transfer and continuation. By providing YuE with a reference disco song, the model can generate new music that exhibits a similar style. This can be particularly effective for capturing the overall sonic texture, instrumentation, and rhythmic feel of disco music.

YuE supports two approaches to style transfer:
1.  **Single-track ICL**: Using a mix, vocal, or instrumental track as reference
2.  **Dual-track ICL**: Using both vocal and instrumental tracks simultaneously, which generally yields better results

For optimal style learning, it is recommended to provide around 30 seconds of reference audio. This feature offers a direct method for creating new disco music that is stylistically consistent with existing tracks, allowing for the generation of novel compositions that maintain the characteristic elements of the disco genre.

### Music Mixing Style Transfer

The work by Junghyun Koo et al. on Music Mixing Style Transfer presents another interesting avenue. Their system utilizes a contrastive learning approach to analyze the mixing style of a reference song, focusing on audio effects, and then transfers this style to an input multitrack.

This could be particularly valuable for a "Disco Musica" application, as disco music often has a characteristic mixing and production style, including:
-   Specific reverb settings (particularly on vocals and drums)
-   Distinctive EQ curves emphasizing bass and high frequencies
-   Compression techniques that create the genre's characteristic "pumping" sound
-   Spatial positioning of instruments in the stereo field

By using this system, one could potentially generate new disco music and then apply the mixing style of a classic disco track to achieve a more authentic sonic quality. The source code and pre-trained models for this research are available on GitHub, along with supplementary materials and a Hugging Face demo.

### Other Style Transfer Tools

Several other open-source tools offer different approaches to style transfer that could be valuable for disco music generation:

#### Groove2Groove

While operating on symbolic MIDI data rather than audio, Groove2Groove offers a system for one-shot music accompaniment style transfer. Given two MIDI files – a content input and a style input – it generates a new accompaniment for the first file in the style of the second one. 

Although it doesn't directly deal with audio, the concept of transferring musical style is relevant and might be applicable in a workflow that involves converting audio to MIDI and back. The project provides source code, trained models, and a dataset of synthetic MIDI accompaniments in various styles.

#### SoundGen and Related Tools

Notably, SoundGen, an instrumental AI music generator, also features audio-to-audio style transfer
continue
capabilities. This suggests that the ability to transfer stylistic elements directly from one audio track to another is becoming an increasingly common feature in AI music generation tools.

Furthermore, the OpenVINO AI Plugins for Audacity include an audio continuation feature powered by MusicGen. This allows users to extend existing music snippets based on a text prompt. For a "Disco Musica" application, this could be used to generate a short disco musical idea and then use this feature to extend it into a longer track.

Finally, Stable Audio Open is an open-source model optimized for generating short audio samples and sound effects using text prompts, and it also offers the capability for audio variations and style transfer of audio samples. This provides another potential tool for manipulating and transforming audio in the context of disco music generation.

6. Image/Video-to-Music Generation
While perhaps less direct for the primary goal of generating disco music, the ability to generate music from visual inputs like images and videos could offer interesting creative possibilities, particularly given the strong visual identity of the disco era.

As mentioned earlier, the Awesome-LLMs-meet-Multimodal-Generation repository serves as a valuable resource for exploring research in this area, including advancements in both video and image generation.

Macaw-LLM represents a step towards comprehensive multimodal models by seamlessly combining image, video, audio, and text data, built upon foundational models like CLIP, Whisper, and LLaMA. This indicates a growing interest in AI systems that can understand and generate across multiple modalities.

Specifically focused on video, Video2Music is a novel framework that uses video features as conditioning input to generate matching music using a Transformer architecture. While the primary application might not be disco, this technology demonstrates the potential for AI to understand the content and emotional tone of video and create appropriate background music. For instance, a video depicting a vibrant disco dance floor could potentially be used as input to generate upbeat and energetic disco music. The project provides a quickstart guide and installation instructions on its GitHub repository.

In a related but inverse task, Backdrop is a web application designed to combine existing music and images into videos. While it doesn't generate music from images, it highlights the established connection between these two modalities in creative applications.

Finally, Cosmos1GP, mentioned in the context of YuEGP, includes an image/video-to-world generator. While the term "world generator" is somewhat abstract in this context, it suggests an ability to interpret visual inputs and create corresponding digital environments or scenes, which could indirectly inspire or inform music generation processes related to disco or other genres.

7. MIDI Processing Tools
The Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) serves as a fundamental standard for representing symbolic music, encoding information about notes, timing, and instrumentation. Open-source tools for processing and manipulating MIDI data are invaluable in AI music generation workflows.

Music21 stands out as a powerful Python-based toolkit for computer-aided musicology. This library offers a comprehensive set of tools for parsing and writing MIDI files, manipulating musical streams and notes, performing sophisticated musical analysis such as key signature and chord detection, and even generating musical notation. For a "Disco Musica" application, Music21 could be used to analyze existing disco MIDI files (if available), extract characteristic chord progressions or rhythmic patterns, or even to represent and manipulate the symbolic output of other AI music generation models before rendering them as audio.

MidiTok is another essential open-source library, specifically focused on the tokenization of MIDI files. Tokenization is the process of converting symbolic music data into a sequence of discrete tokens, a format that is readily usable by many machine learning models, particularly Transformer-based architectures. MidiTok supports a wide range of popular MIDI tokenization techniques, such as REMI and Compound Word, and provides a unified API for ease of use. Its integration with the Hugging Face Hub allows for easy sharing and access to tokenizers and models. Furthermore, MidiTok offers features for data augmentation and for splitting large MIDI files into smaller chunks suitable for training AI models. For developing a "Disco Musica" generation model, MidiTok would be crucial for preparing any MIDI datasets of disco music for training.

Werckmeister is presented as an open-source Sheet Music MIDI Compiler. This tool allows users to prototype songs, transcribe sheet music, and experiment with chord progressions by writing music in a readable source code format that is then compiled into a MIDI file. This could be useful for creating MIDI representations of disco musical ideas or for experimenting with harmonic structures typical of the genre.

Finally, MidiTok Visualizer is a web application designed to help users understand and analyze different MIDI tokenization techniques, particularly those implemented in the MidiTok library. This tool provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the tokens extracted from MIDI files, along with an interactive piano roll display, aiding in the research and analysis of symbolic music data.

8. Singing Voice Synthesis
Given that vocals are often a defining element of disco music, open-source tools for singing voice synthesis (SVS) are relevant to the creation of a "Disco Musica" application.

As previously mentioned, Amphion includes Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) among its supported tasks, although it is currently marked as "developing." However, its inclusion indicates an ongoing effort within the open-source community to address this important aspect of music generation.

Utau and its open-source successor, OpenUtau, are free, cross-platform singing voice synthesis frameworks based on concatenative synthesis. These tools allow users to create custom voicebanks by recording and annotating vocal sounds, which can then be used to synthesize singing based on input melodies and lyrics. While the technology is somewhat older compared to recent deep learning approaches, Utau and OpenUtau remain powerful and customizable options for generating vocal parts.

Rocaloid is another free and open-source singing voice synthesis system that aims to synthesize natural, flexible, and multi-lingual vocal parts. It emphasizes providing users with more controllable parameters to fine-tune the synthesized voice.

Beyond dedicated SVS tools, the broader field of open-source Text-to-Speech (TTS) has seen significant advancements. Models like XTTS-v2, ChatTTS, MeloTTS, and OpenVoice offer high-quality speech synthesis and, in some cases, features like voice cloning and multilingual support. While primarily designed for spoken language, these models might potentially be adapted or used in conjunction with other tools to generate vocal elements for disco music, perhaps by training them on singing data or by manipulating their output to achieve a singing-like quality.

9. Potential Approaches for "Disco Musica" Generation
Leveraging the open-source tools and techniques discussed, several potential approaches could be explored for creating a "Disco Musica" application:

Fine-tuning existing models: A powerful approach would involve fine-tuning a pre-trained model like YuE or MusicGen on a large, high-quality, and ethically sourced dataset of disco music. This process would adapt the model's internal parameters to better capture the specific stylistic characteristics of the genre, including its rhythmic patterns, instrumentation (such as the prominent use of strings, brass, and synthesizers), and characteristic harmonic progressions.
Utilizing detailed text prompts with control: Models like Mustango and Music ControlNet, which offer granular control over musical elements, could be effectively used by crafting detailed text prompts that explicitly describe the desired features of a disco track. This would include specifying the tempo (typically around 120 BPM), time signature (usually 4/4), specific rhythmic patterns (like the four-on-the-floor beat), characteristic chord progressions, and the desired instrumentation.
Employing style transfer: The in-context learning capabilities of YuE could be directly utilized by providing the model with reference audio of classic disco tracks. This would guide the generation of new music in a similar style, potentially capturing the overall "feel" and sonic texture of disco. Similarly, exploring the mixing style transfer techniques offered by projects like jhtonyKoo/music_mixing_style_transfer could help achieve an authentic disco sound.
Combining symbolic and audio generation: A modular approach could involve using Muse Coco to generate the underlying symbolic structure of a disco track based on textual descriptions, and then employing open-source synthesizers or sound libraries (perhaps using tools like FluidSynth) to render the MIDI output with sounds reminiscent of the disco era.
Modular approach: A more complex but potentially highly customizable approach would be to combine different open-source tools for specific tasks. For instance, one could use Music ControlNet for generating the characteristic disco rhythm section, a fine-tuned TTS model (or a dedicated SVS tool if quality is sufficient) for generating vocals, and another model for the harmonic and melodic elements, integrating these components using MIDI processing libraries like Music21 and MidiTok.
10. Conclusion
The landscape of open-source multimodal AI music generation is rich and rapidly evolving, offering a diverse array of tools and techniques that hold significant potential for creative applications. Projects like YuE, VMB, MusicGen, Mustango, and Music ControlNet represent significant advancements, each with unique architectures and capabilities that address different aspects of music generation from various input modalities.

For the specific goal of generating disco music, the open-source ecosystem provides several promising avenues. The style transfer capabilities of YuE, the fine-grained control offered by Mustango and Music ControlNet, and the structured approach of Muse Coco all present viable strategies. Furthermore, the ability to manipulate and analyze symbolic music using tools like Music21 and MidiTok provides a solid foundation for building and refining AI-generated disco tracks.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain. The need for high-quality, genre-specific training data is paramount for achieving truly authentic results. The computational resources required for training and running these advanced models can be substantial. Additionally, certain aspects, such as generating high-fidelity, genre-specific
