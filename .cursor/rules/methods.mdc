# Enhancing "Disco Musica" with Multimodal AI Music Generation Techniques

## 1. Introduction: The Landscape of Multimodal AI Music Generation and "Disco Musica"

The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly advancing, with multimodal AI emerging as a significant area of development. Multimodal AI focuses on the processing and integration of information from various data modalities, such as text, audio, images, and video, to enable more sophisticated and human-like interactions [1]. In the context of music generation, this approach holds immense potential for creating richer, more nuanced, and controllable musical experiences compared to traditional single-modal methods [1]. Recent progress in deep learning, particularly the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs) and innovative diffusion models, has significantly accelerated the evolution of multimodal AI in music generation, opening up new avenues for creative expression and user interaction [3].

The development of AI-driven music generation applications reflects a growing recognition of the limitations inherent in systems that rely on a single input modality. For instance, text-only systems might struggle to capture the subtle nuances of musical style or desired melodic contours, while audio-only systems lack the high-level semantic understanding that text can provide. By combining multiple modalities, developers aim to create tools that leverage the strengths of each, leading to more versatile and potentially higher-quality music generation outcomes. This trend signifies a move towards more intuitive and expressive control for users, allowing them to interact with AI music generation systems in ways that more closely mirror human creative processes.

This report explores the potential enhancements for an application called "Disco Musica" by examining recent research in multimodal AI music generation. While specific details about the current functionalities of "Disco Musica" are not provided within the research material, it is assumed that the application currently allows users to generate disco music based on certain input parameters or basic text prompts. The objective of this analysis is to identify how the latest advancements in AI techniques and the integration of multimodal inputs could significantly improve the application's capabilities, ultimately leading to a more engaging and authentic disco music creation experience for its users. The motivation for this exploration stems from the desire to enhance the quality and coherence of the generated music, provide users with more granular control over various musical elements, enable novel interaction methods through diverse input modalities, and ensure that "Disco Musica" remains at the forefront of the rapidly evolving AI music generation landscape.

## 2. Recent Research in Multimodal AI Music Generation (2023-2025)

Recent research in multimodal AI music generation has explored various techniques that leverage different combinations of input modalities to create music. These advancements offer promising pathways for enhancing the functionalities of applications like "Disco Musica."

### 2.1. Text-Conditioned Multimodal Music Generation

Several recent studies have focused on techniques that utilize text alongside other modalities to guide music creation. This allows for a combination of semantic understanding from text and specific musical cues from other inputs.

* **Meta's MusicGen:** Stands out as a state-of-the-art text-to-music model with the added capability of being conditioned on melodic features. This model employs a single-stage autoregressive Transformer architecture, trained on an extensive dataset of music. The ability to combine text and melody input in MusicGen offers a direct method for users to control both the high-level semantic content, through textual descriptions of the desired mood, instrumentation, and genre, and the specific melodic structure, by providing an audio input containing the desired melody. This approach could be particularly beneficial for "Disco Musica," allowing users to, for example, hum a bassline or a catchy disco riff and then use text to describe the desired harmonic accompaniment, drum patterns, and overall style, enabling a more personalized and controlled generation process [3].
* **Mustango:** Is another significant contribution in the realm of controllable text-to-music generation. This model distinguishes itself by incorporating music domain knowledge, enabling it to be conditioned with rich text prompts that include specific instructions pertaining to musical elements such as chords, beats, tempo, and key. Mustango achieves this control through a novel MuNet module, integrated within a diffusion model framework, which guides the music generation process based on these detailed musical conditions provided in the text prompt. For "Disco Musica," Mustango's emphasis on music-specific text prompts could be invaluable, as it would allow users to precisely dictate the harmonic and rhythmic aspects of the generated disco music, ensuring adherence to the genre's characteristic musical structures [3].
* **Instruct-MusicGen:** While primarily focused on editing, the research on Instruct-MusicGen, which explores instruction tuning for text-to-music editing within Music Language Models, also holds relevance [9]. This work demonstrates the potential of using detailed textual instructions to manipulate musical elements. Although its primary application is in editing existing music, the underlying techniques for understanding and acting upon musical instructions provided in text could inform the development of more sophisticated and controllable generation strategies within "Disco Musica" [9]. Users could potentially provide detailed textual commands for specific musical edits or generation parameters, such as "add a walking bassline in the key of C minor" or "increase the hi-hat frequency in the second chorus."

### 2.2. Audio-Driven Music Generation and Style Transfer

Research exploring music generation driven by audio inputs, including style transfer techniques, offers valuable insights for enhancing "Disco Musica," particularly in capturing the stylistic nuances of the disco genre.

* **VMB (Visuals Music Bridge):** Is a framework primarily focused on visual inputs but also addresses text-to-music and controllable music generation, employing retrieval augmentation to condition the model on relevant music pieces [3]. Its dual-track music retrieval module, which combines broad and targeted retrieval strategies, could be adapted by "Disco Musica" to retrieve existing disco tracks or specific musical phrases based on user input, whether text or other modalities, and subsequently use these retrieved elements to guide the generation of new disco music. This retrieval-augmented generation approach could help ensure that the generated music aligns with established disco conventions and user preferences [3].
* **Stable Audio Open:** Is another significant open-source model capable of generating short audio samples and sound effects from text prompts, with the added functionality of audio variation and style transfer. For "Disco Musica," this model could be particularly useful for its style transfer capabilities. By potentially fine-tuning Stable Audio Open on a comprehensive dataset of disco music, the application could gain an enhanced ability to generate music that authentically captures the sonic characteristics of the genre. Furthermore, its style transfer functionality could be leveraged to transform music generated by other models or even user-provided audio into the distinct disco style.
* **Mixing Style Transfer:** The research on mixing style transfer, which focuses on transferring the mixing style of a reference song to an input multitrack using contrastive learning, is also highly relevant. Disco music possesses characteristic sonic qualities arising from its production techniques, such as specific reverb settings, compression levels, and equalization. Implementing mixing style transfer within "Disco Musica" could significantly enhance the authenticity of the generated disco tracks by enabling the application to replicate these sonic characteristics of classic disco recordings, resulting in a more professional and genre-specific sound [3].

### 2.3. Visual Modalities in Music Generation

The integration of visual modalities, such as images and videos, into music generation offers exciting possibilities for creating music that is thematically or mood-based, which could be particularly relevant for generating disco music inspired by visual content.

* **VMB:** As previously mentioned, VMB includes image-to-music and video-to-music generation capabilities by first employing a Multimodal Music Description Model to interpret visual inputs and then generating music based on the derived textual descriptions [13]. This indirect approach, while not directly using visual features for music synthesis, provides a viable pathway for "Disco Musica" to generate music inspired by visual inputs. For instance, a user could upload an image of a classic disco album art or a vibrant disco dance floor scene, and the application could first generate a textual description of the visual content and then use this description to guide the generation of disco music that evokes a similar mood or style [13].
* **Generative Disco:** While primarily focused on music visualization, introduces the concept of beat-synced generation, where text prompts are warped and images are generated according to the beat of the music [15]. Although its main application is in creating visualizers, this research highlights the importance of temporal alignment between music and visuals. If "Disco Musica" aims to incorporate a visualization feature, the beat-synced generation approach could be a key consideration for ensuring that the visual elements dynamically react to the rhythm and tempo of the generated disco music, enhancing the overall user experience [15].

### 2.4. MIDI as a Control and Generation Modality

While the research snippets do not contain specific recent research papers focusing on MIDI in multimodal AI music generation within the last 1-2 years, MIDI remains a crucial modality in music technology, serving both as a control mechanism and a representation for generated music in many existing models.

* **Basic Pitch:** Spotify's lightweight audio-to-MIDI converter, offers the capability to accurately transcribe audio recordings into MIDI format, including the detection of pitch bends [17]. For "Disco Musica," Basic Pitch could be an invaluable tool for analyzing the musical structure of existing disco songs by converting their audio into MIDI. This symbolic representation of melody, harmony, and rhythm could then be used as a foundation for style transfer techniques or for extracting specific musical features to inform the generation of new disco music [17].
* **MidiTok:** Is a Python package specifically designed for MIDI file tokenization [26]. MIDI tokenization is an essential step when working with deep learning models like Transformers, as it converts the symbolic MIDI data into a sequence of tokens that the model can process. If "Disco Musica" aims to incorporate MIDI as an input for
